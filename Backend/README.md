# Error Encountered : 

## Face the duplication error the mongodb : 

Basically once to run your index.js your db file got connected by your database the schema u have written got saved in the mongodb 

Due to this if u tweaked it furthur and expecting it to work accordingly it won't 

U have to manually delete the currently save schema by compass or by mongodb cli and then run the node app again .
